# GitRecommender

I wanted to make a recommender system and brush up on C#, so here we are. This is built on .NET 7 Maui, which is .NET's platform for 
building cross platform and mobile apps, similar to React Native. GitRecommender is powered by the Github API and SQLite (for now). 

The goal here is to make a recommender system based entirely on vectors constructed from stargazer relationships, at least at first. I 
want to include more later on.


## Work in progress

This is a work in progress, it is not ready to use.
